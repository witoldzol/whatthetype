# fix complex data type inference bug - test_complicated_structure
# type 'type' as Type[]
ex: str => Type[str], <class type> => Type[figure out what type it is of]
remember to add import
# refactor typed dicts to use typed tuples - better experience and supported by 3.5 python
# resolve mypy issues
# install ruff and resolve ruff issues
# run tests for both 3.9 and 3.10 python at the same time ( use tox ? )
# create a big 'integration' test with documentation on how to run it / how it works -> so that when i forget, i know what's going on
this test will run against one big block of code with all the possible stuff,
 multilines,
 weird formatting,
 context managers,
 lambdas,
...
# fix bug where typed dictionary with key as 'None' is skipped ( only python 3.9 )
value = {None: {None, 1}, "b": {"a"}}
Actual             -     'Union[...
Expected           +     'None,set[..

# investigate why 'type' is being imported (pymongo.mongo_client)
# if only None was detected for the param, dont add this type
it makes no sense to have a None only para ex:
def foo(a: None) -> str:
...
# save intermediate steps to a file?
pass in file pointer to type_it_like_its_hot ?

# implement generic group by field function - update_files_with_new_signatures
# implement field validation of the inputs
# implement no union operator
# should we deduplicate inputs from step 1? the data set will grow crazy big, and it will make step 2 work much harder ( although, we do have dedup in step 2...)
# refactor update_code_with_types
maybe use separate passes where we handle args and return types/values
this would greatly simplyfy the necessary logic

# identify 'self' & 'cls' aka first arg of class method, and give it 'special' arg,
so that we can mark it as `SELF_OR_CLS`
why? so we can skip in further steps, THIS IS NOT STRICTLY NECESSARY, but it's 'best' for completion sake to capture all args, even self refrences
```python
class Foo():
    def bob(omg, wow):
        return wow
result = {
    'module_function_line': {
        'args': {
            'omg': ['SELF_OR_CLS'],
            'wow': ['str']
        },
        'return': ['str']
    }
}
```
# add tests around self ref object
# add test case where we trace same function twice, and verify we don't store duplicate types
# convert 'NoneType' to 'None' ( step 2 or 3 ????)
# fix union of types
## expectations
```python
value = {"a": {None}, "b": {"a"}}
actual = convert_value_to_type(value)
assert "dict[str,set[str|None]]" == actual
```
## reality
```python
value = {"a": {1}, "b": {"a"}}
actual = convert_value_to_type(value)
assert "dict[str,set[int|str]]" == actual
AssertionError: assert 'dict[str,set[int|str]]' == 'dict[str,set...str,set[str]]'

  - dict[str,set[int]|str,set[str]]
  ?                 - --------
  + dict[str,set[int|str]]
```
## what about 
value = [{1},{'a'}] ??
should it be list[set[int|str]] ? or list[set[int]|set[str]] ??
## final decision
I will leave it as
pyright didn't complain about either:
```python
l = [{1}, {'a'}]
def foo(l: list[set[int|str]]) -> int:
def foo(l: list[set[int]|set[str]]) -> int:
```
# put None at the end if union of types
# in step 2 end, unify results array
at the moment convert_results_to_types will return an array of types per function argument
we defo want to 'unify' those results into one, so that step 3 can just update with one arg?
OR, we add a new step
BECAUSE if we have an array of multiple results, that's an easy way to identify an arg that takes in multple 
DIFFERENT types ( which is probably an BUG or potential issue )
# test collables as args and as return types
# in step 5 - when you detect a pre existing type, there can be MULTIPLE of them - test & handle this case
at the moment we are dropping first detected type
```bash

def example_function(a: float|bool, b, foo):

def example_function (a :int|str|bool ,b :int|str,foo :str|None):
```
# implement replacement algo
# deal with user classes types
# fix default value missing when original function has type and default value set to None
```python
# before
def foobar(i:int = None) -> int:
    return i
# after tokenizing
def foobar (i :int=)->int :
```
# usedefault in dictionaries to simplyfy logic 
# generate warnings if arg takes two or more types of data
# reformat updated function definitions to make it nice
# update actual files with the new code and create .bak files
# when upating files, build a list of modules, and updated them in a batch
# new  stage - generate imports
# fix indentation issue - __init__ method doesn't get indented properly
# implement python 3.5 <= and => 3.9 union types ( Union[] )
# add Union imports
# when walking the ast, make sure that you correctly identify function
dunder functions will match first instance in a file, ex. __init__ 
so, if this is a dunder method, we need to identify the 'owner' class first, or jump to line and then walk?
# fix multiline multiple decorators 
# handle multi line function signatures
# handle *args and **kwargs
looks like tracing *args results in args that have no name...which makes sense
im happy with just return types
# check if step_1 output is actuall raw data
# fix warnings
# function parsing fails if final brace is on a different line then last argument
def bob(a,
        b,
) <- this will fail, because we detect last line of function to == line of the last argument
-> actual solution was to fix bad implementation of signature end detection and bad implementation of line replacement in file
# acomodate one line functions 
we will need to include the signature or body offset -> this way we know where the sig ends
## refactor the code to move f_end, body_start and sig/body offset to the data
